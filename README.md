- 👋 Hi, I’m @veelcheck which is spelled "wilczek" in my native language.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java Script, and - oh  my Gosh - it gives me an equal amount of joy and frustration as raising my two kids! I am not crazy, it just works that way, right?
- 💞️ We'll see what the future has in store for me.
